# Questions for the Elders During Covid 

### Before the Meeting

- Pray for wisdom and humility
- Keep an open mind, I that must admit that I don’t know everything. I’m not a scientist. I’m not a pastor.
- Be earnest, not accusatory. Try to hear their reasoning for the way they handle this, try to understand how difficult these decisions are.
- Remember that these men are my spiritual authorities. God has placed them over me for years and years for my spiritual good, and I must respect them.
- Remember they are dear brothers in Christ, who have loved me and supported me throughout so many phases of life.

### Questions to ask the elders

- Why do you not ask members to wear masks and socially distance? What Scripture helped influence that decision?
- What are your concerns with enforcing masks and social distancing?
- Do you think the COVID situation is an opportunity to practice Romans 14? Or does it not apply?
- If the elders ask "what would it take?" or "what resources do you have that support masks and social distancing?"
    - First, for us to come back, we would need everyone to wear masks and practice social distancing. We don't think this is too much to ask, and there are many other churches that hold this policy. This is not a case of church clergy enforcing a government mandate, this is an instance of church clergy taking sensible caution from scientific evidence for the good of the people.
    - Resources that support masks and social distancing:
        - [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)
        - It is necessary for all congregants to wear masks because someone could be spreading the virus and not know about it. The masks don't protect you from a potential carrier, they protect other people if you are a carrier.
    - Lastly, I would express my disappointment that the elders shift the weight of this decision onto the members of the congregation, instead of the elders. The elders are called to protect the flock, not manipulate them into feeling guilty and winning against their conscience.
- “You shouldn’t live in fear,” “there are always risks in life,” “if you get it you’ll get it,”
    - To us, this is not a matter of fear, but a matter of basic precautions and not living recklessly. We drive our cars and risk getting in an accident, but we wear seatbelts. Yes there will always be risks, but there are basic cautions we can take. This is a global pandemic, and we should not take safety lightly.
    - This is also a matter of conscience for us. With being new parents, we are trying to keep Theo safe. We feel that we would be putting him at risk taking him to the service the way things are right now, and we just can’t do that. Our conscience won’t allow it.
- “The spiritual negatives far outweigh the physical positives of wearing masks”
    - I believe you can still fellow and love one another while staying 6ft apart and wearing a mask. Why is there this idea that you can’t?
    
- At this point where RCF is with this issue, we will start attending a new church.

## Outcome Notes

- The elders consistently tried to argue that the data doesn't support the concern some people have, and that the risk is worth taking
- Kenny constantly tried to convince me that the sanctuary was a safe space, that he doesn't understand how someone could catch the virus if they had 10 feet of space, especially in the balcony. To him, there isn't enough evidence to show that wearing masks will make a difference if you can keep the droplets at bay
- Consistently said the numbers were not as bad as the flu
- At this point, if they asked everyone to socially distance, they wouldn't be able to because attendance was so large
- When it came to a matter of conscience and Romans 14, my own father said "this is my favorite point of discussion: at what point does the weaker brother grow up??"
- The elders intentions are genuine, they want to create a safe space for those who are at risk, but see masks and social distancing as an extreme requirement, that the data does not support.
- The elders said they publicly teach Romans 14, but that teaching is boiled down to "just show respect to those wearing masks," not a true exposition and teaching of the spiritual principles at hand.
- In the end the elders would hate to see us go. Mike said we should at least give it one try before leaving, to see how safe it actually is if we sit apart from people. Kenny said he would be disappointed, and would disconnect us further from the body like we already are. All in all, they still love us, and would understand our decision.
