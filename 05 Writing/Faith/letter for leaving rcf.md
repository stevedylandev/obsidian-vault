# Letter for Leaving RCF

I, Steven D Simkins, and Madison G. Simkins, are having difficulty submitting to the elders of RCF for the following reasons. 

1. How COVID was handled, without compassion towards the weaker brother 
    1. As of September 27th, we feel uncomfortable attending RCF with the current status of COVID-19 and how the elders are handling precautions. To our understanding, the elders current approach is to move into the larger sanctuary, install "antimicrobial air filters," and asking members to keep their distance from those wearing masks to church. We do not feel that these measures are sufficient for multiple reasons. 
        1. The larger sanctuary will not help stop the spread of the virus since the average attendance has increased significantly. 
        2. Sources say these antimicrobial air filters are not effective against the spread of COVID, or at least there is not enough evidence to say they are an effective means. ([https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/air-cleaners-hvac-filters-and-coronavirus-covid-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/air-cleaners-hvac-filters-and-coronavirus-covid-19)) 
        3. Without a commitment from the whole body to follow social distancing guidelines and practice wearing masks, RCF is taking basic precautions to be safe and to help those at risk. 
    2. Furthermore, we believe the approach of the elders as of late has been to dismiss each concern that an at risk member has, and counter it with some excuse or way to appease the concern, rather that being compassionate or forceful with state requirements. 
2. Complete disregard for events that happened this year. We are never guided on how the Christian should respond to these things. There is no room for open conversation about the things happening in the world. 
3. The weekly preaching has been "ear tickling" for reformed Christians, and rarely applications that challenge our sin as reformed Christians that push us to grow in Spiritual maturity
