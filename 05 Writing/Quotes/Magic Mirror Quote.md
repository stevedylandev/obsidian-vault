When you have kids a thing in you dies. You give up all the youngness you had left, and in a way you die too. But it’s this way with all good things, a sacrifice that stands between you and everything good. You see children take your old used up faded glory and they kill it, but in return they give you something else. They take your dying youth and give you a chance to experience a new childhood. Not just inflated memories of some forgotten glory days but a glorious new youth. They kill you, but they give you a new life. 

They give you the opportunity to enjoy all the things that you and your smug sophistication forgot that you love. They give you snakes, and horses, and trampolines. They give you Mario and Saturday cartoons. They give you dogs and bicycles and nature shows. They give you costumes, trains and airplanes, papier-mâché, comic books, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Dr. Seuss. 

When everyone else passes a cow or a horse as though it was just a tree or a rock, you get to stop and glory again and their majesty. Then you get to glory in the rock and the tree too, because you’re sad glazed over practical numb to beauty eyes have been torn open again by creatures that still recognize the transcendence of things that we have mistakenly grown to consider common. They find a galaxy of meaning in a duck, a frog or a baseball. In this way children literally see the world better and more accurately then we do. They teach us a new way to see the world, ourselves, and God.
