# Ode to House 

A cool autumn day, I pull up to the house 
I take out the key and in a turn go inside 
An almost empty shell, remnants of a home 
I begin to remember all that happened here 

This was more than just a house though 
This is where we spent nights painting 
This is where we tore up carpet staples 
This is where we slowly decorated walls 
This is where we made food every night 
This is where we laughed and cried 
This is where we binged Gilmore Girls
This is where we welcomed people in
This is where we kept to ourselves 
This is where we stayed inside 
This is where we brought home a son 
This is where he screamed and laughed
This is where he crawled and read 
This is where He showed His goodness
This was more than just a house 
This was home 

While I stand here feeling the void
I remember His goodness then
And I await the next day 
When home can be again
