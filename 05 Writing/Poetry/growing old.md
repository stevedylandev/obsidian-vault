# Growing Old

Some days I ponder growing old

The grim fate that greets us all

Our faces wrinkled

Our joints aching

Our memories slipping

Our friends passing

While the future is dark

I see another side

As we become weary

We’ll look back see

We lived our lives

We saw the sun rise

We felt the rays golden

We smelled the roses red

We tasted the harvest ripe

Our feet danced

Our eyes gazed

Our hands worked

Our souls were bound

Our children grew

Our years flew

Despite the valley we must pass through

I’m so thankful I’ll go with you
