# Three Trees

Three trees

One green
One black
One white

The green gave birth
Roots, branches, fruit
Declared beautiful and good
With one bite became corrupt

The black saw death
Bare, cut, bloody
Wrecked with sorrow and shaking
With one breath the wrong undone

The white points forward
Bright, pure, new
No more death, no more pain
With one blink, perfection
