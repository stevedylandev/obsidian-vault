# The Bee

Outside my window is a bush
Not an ordinary bush though 
This bush is full of white flowers
All year long the bees gather here
From the rise of the sun to its setting
In the morning light I love to look 
And see these bees glimmer in sunshine
Yet in this glimpse of work and joy 
Now and again, I see a still bee 
He sits on the flower, for hours
Motionless, cool, unstirred
It would appear this worker has died
I ponder how long his wings buzzed 
How many trips he made to the hive
How short his life, how much he did
In the end with sorrow I admit
Heâ€™s just another bee in the bush
