Dear Old Point Family, 

I have been part of this great company for the last four years and it was been a wonderful experience in my life. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with such admirable people who care for each other and strive for excellence in everything they do. It has set a model for me and my family for how a company should treat it's employees and it's customers. With that said it grieves me to inform you that my last day as Lead Customer Inquiry Specialist at Old Point National Bank will be 1/7/2021. As much as I love the people here at Old Point, my family needs me more. I have accepted a position that will allow me and my family to move closer to my wife's family, to care for her elderly parents and her brother who has a terminal illness. I will miss each person here and I will cherish the memories made here for the rest of my life. I wish you all the best, and I hope Old Point continues to be a light in the Hampton roads area and beyond!

Sincerely, 

Steve Simkins
