My Dear Madison,

A year ago today we celebrated your birthday under some less desirable circumstances. You were v pregnant, we were in the midst of a pandemic, and when you tried to make yourself dinner it didn't work out the way you meant it to. It was difficult to say the least. However at the end of the day, we got Pelicans and stood out by Lion's Gate bridge to enjoy the sunset, and it was beautiful.

We didn't think it could get more challenging, then we had Theo. I think we both shudder at the thought of those first three months; the late hours, the unending screaming, that feeling like it would never end. Even now things are still not that easy, like this past weekend when he pooped FOUR TIMES IN ONE DAY. Just crazy. But just like last year, there are glimpses of joy and peace, like when Theo turns the pages in his favorite book, or when he smiles and coos. Even when he shrieks with joy its hard not to laugh through the sleep deprived looks on our faces.

I reflect on these things as we celebrate today, thinking there's no one else I would want to be Theo's mother. Even through the dark days of early parenthood, even in the moments when you feel like you've failed, I see a determined mother driven by love for her child to keep pressing in. I see an intelligent, wise, courageous, caring, and thoughtful woman who has laid down so much of her own life down for those she deeply cares about. I couldn't begin to imagine another woman who deserves more celebration than you, my quen beb :)

Here's to you, Madison; may I never grow tired of celebrating you as the most wonderful person I know and love!

Steve
