Dear Garrett and Rachel,

When I think of this time last year, I think of the cold. I remember the year before that when Madison and I still lived in Norfolk, when we lived in a small apartment made in the 1940’s. The heating was a big pipe that went through our living room and turned on when the apartment office decided to. It was November, a chilling 40 degrees outside, and a somehow worse 50 degrees inside. We huddled under blankets until at once the heat came on and we celebrated! That was two years ago though, and the cold last year was different from then.

We were so excited to move into our new home, full of its character and quirks. Our books already felt at home, and the few things we had made it feel like home so quickly. Then the cold came, and we soon realized the heat was not working. We were slightly nervous because we certainly did not have the money to buy a new unit, but you assured us that everything would work out. Then came the battle with the warranty, all of the numerous contractors with their theories and estimates, all the while you fought to make things right. Despite your best efforts, they would not budge, so you stepped in and took care of us out of your own pocket. I don’t think I have ever been so touched, humbled, and broken by such generosity; I was dumbfounded. I’ll never forget when we turned out heat on with the new unit; the feeling of warmth. It was nowhere near as cold as it was that November day in Norfolk, but the heat was so much sweeter that day in our new home.

Now I look back as we have lived in our new home for a year, thinking of all the fond memories that have been shared here. I think about all the Lidl brand wine we’ve had while watching Gilmore Girls. I think about all the food we’ve enjoyed with friends and family. I think about the numerous Bible studies that have gathered here, with people who would have probably never come otherwise. I think about the number of CNU students Madison has ministered to in our home. I think about the many fires we enjoyed in our fireplace during the winter months, adding log after log into the night as we listened to nothing but warm crackling. I think about how much I will miss this home when we eventually move. I think about you, Garrett and Rachel Maroon. The thankfulness, gratitude, and warmth I feel towards you both is something I can hardly express with words. That is why I am writing this letter to you, hoping that these written words express more than I could in person and speech. To make a long story short:

Thank you.

Your impact on our lives can not be overstated, and we are so thankful to have you both in our lives. I hope this letter serves as a physical token of our love and gratitude for you, and a reminder of God’s grace that works through you, in ways you may not realize. May He continue bless you, your marriage, and your children.

“Grant us grace to savor this season
As we live it together,
That in later days the memory
Of this place and these times
Will linger sweetly, shaping
Our lives,
Our words,
Our deeds.”

Love, Steve & Madison
