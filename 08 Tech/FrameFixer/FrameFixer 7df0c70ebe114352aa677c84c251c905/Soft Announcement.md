Today I’m excited to announce a new side project I’m building: FrameFixer! You can check out the new website at framefixer.co, but let me also go ahead and explain what it is and why I’m building it as it’s a pretty niche solution.

Before I got into tech I had several years of experience being a professional photographer. I shot weddings, engagements, portraits, all the stuff, but primarily weddings. Something that happens a lot in the pro event photography arena is hiring a second photographer to help take photos. 

These “second shooters” typically are less experienced, take the photos, then give the memory card to the lead photographer to edit later on. When the main photographer gets back, they have to merge both sets of photos into one collection, edit it, and deliver it to the client as a cohesive piece. But there’s usually one small problem…

The photos are out of order! This happens because the photographers did not sync the time and date on their cameras, a small detail that gets overlooked a lot. The photographer then has to manually fix the time data in a program like Lightroom and let me tell you, it’s a pain. My wife edits photos professionally for a photographer and she always complained about the process. 

FrameFixer will essentially do that work for you, using AI to find the same event/subject from both sets of photos, find the offset, then correct the photos automatically. It’s a simple product, but something I believe done right, could save 15-30 mins of time for each event shot. I’ve already done brief research to see if people would bite and got a great response, so I’m excited to start building!
