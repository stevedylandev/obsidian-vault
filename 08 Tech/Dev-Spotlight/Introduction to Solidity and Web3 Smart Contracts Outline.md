## Outline
- Introduction
	- Blockchains before Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
	- EVM emergence
	- Concept of decentralized applications
	- Solidity and Smart Contracts at the core of EVM
- What is Solidity?
	- Statically-typed programming language designed for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM chains
	- Gives developers ability to define what a decentralized app can and can't do
	- Has features such as inheritance, libraries you can import, and can work with complex data types
- What are Smart Contracts?
	- Compiled Solidity byte code that runs on the EVM
	- Allows developers to create apps that can run on blockchains
	- Blockchains work as a "peer-to-peer" network which can give a trust-less state to applications
	- Concept of smart contracts being self-governed has brought about the use of tokens, decentralized governance, supply chain integrity, and NFTs
- Smart Contract Basics
	- Quick reference to OpenZeppelin standards (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)
	- Writing a simple smart contract that stores data using Remix (Might go to something more towards ERC-20 to handle token transfers. Also possible to go towards a smart contract that transfers USDC as a segue to Circle APIs later.).
	- Deploying to the blockchain and interacting with it
	- Libraries to interact with smart contracts through Ethereum RPC nodes, such as Ethers or Viem
	- Display how Circle APIs can do a lot with wallets, transfers, and currency exchange with a simple REST Api rather than writing custom smart contracts
- Conclusion
	- Recap of solidity and smart contracts 
	- Resources for deeper dives into smart contracts
	- Circle API resources for those going to DeFi
