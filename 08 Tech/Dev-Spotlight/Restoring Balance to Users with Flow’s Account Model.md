# Restoring Balance to Users with Flow’s Account Model
#tech/dev-spotlight

There are lots of new blockchains being formed every year, but something you may not know is that the majority of them are quite similar. Bitcoin is considered to be the first true blockchain but was purely monetary. Ethereum paved the way for how blockchains operate today with the concept of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), where code can be run independently on-chain in the form of smart contracts. Many alternative blockchains that have emerged are classified as “EVM” chains, meaning they operate exactly like Ethereum but have a different execution layer. This helps the cross-compatibility of smart contracts across chains, but it doesn’t solve some of the crucial problems embedded in the EVM system. In particular, the way it handles accounts for users and keeps them safe. Flow, a new layer 1 blockchain, changes that pattern with unique solutions in it’s account model. 

## Accounts on Ethereum
One of the best ways to understand how the Flow account model stands out among the rest is to compare it to Ethereum. There are two types of accounts on Ethereum: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA), which are your typical wallets that consumers use; then there are Smart Contract accounts. EOAs have a public and private key pair, where the public key is derived from the private key and works as an address for the account, and the private key signs transactions on the blockchain. They can hold a balance and interact with other accounts, primarily Smart Contract accounts. These Smart Contract accounts are compiled byte code that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. What’s really interesting is that anything created by the smart contract such as tokens or NFTs, the actual data is stored in that smart contract. Instead of an EOA truly owning the token, the smart contract simply says who owns what and how much. Not only that, but smart contracts on Ethereum are hard to read and audit for security. This is one of the disadvantages of the EVM model of accounts, because the power is put in the owner of the smart contracts. A great number of scams and “rug pulls” have occurred on EVM chains because of this imbalance of power. Such a scam would usually go down in the form of a website that looks very similar to a popular NFT project, touting a new collection at a reasonable mint price. People visit the site, connect their wallet, and when they click that mint button, they really have no idea or no way of knowing what they’re signing or what will happen next. As a result, most of the user’s funds are drained and they lose control of their wallet. 

## Accounts on Flow
The cofounders of Flow, who actually wrote the ERC-721 NFT standard and started CryptoKitties, saw these problems with the dual account model on Ethereum and decided to create something revolutionary. The Flow account model combines the concepts of the EOA and Smart Contract accounts from Ethereum into a single standard. In this model the account and the public keys are decoupled. As stated earlier, Ethereum accounts only have a public and private key and they are tied to the account itself. With the Flow account model you can have a single account with multiple public and private keys. Having multiple keys is a huge advantage because you can revoke or rotate keys that might be compromised. Not only that, these keys are weighted keys, giving them the ability to do more complex transactions such as multi signatures. These are the kinds of features that help onboard masses to crypto and blockchain, which Flow is quite well known for with its Top Shot NBA project among others.

Since there can be multiple keys for one account, the way Flow creates addresses is also unique. Unlike Ethereum where addresses are derived from the public key, Flow account addresses are created with an internal on-chain checksum at the protocol level. This ensures addresses are unique but also makes them much easier to read and use. On other blockchains it can be very easy to mistype or have bad punctuation and send assets to the wrong address, which causes EVM users to accidentally lose funds every year. The Flow model helps prevent this and creates a much better end user experience. In addition, Flow gives developers and users the option of different signature and hash algorithm curves such as secp256k1 used primarily by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, or the more flexible P-256 which is adopted by most cellphones and computers. These options provide better flexibility and compatibility with other protocols and ultimately give users top notch security with devices they already have. 

Another thing unique to Flow’s account model is its storage capabilities. On Ethereum, only Smart Contract accounts have the ability to store data and thus truly own assets. You can think of it almost like leasing out car, where if you rent it you do get to drive it, maybe even put it in your garage, but its not truly yours. There’s a contract saying you own the car under certain terms, and the ultimate power is in that contract and it’s terms which may not always be favorable towards the renter. Flow accounts on the other hand have a storage system that allows them to store assets, as well as deploy their own smart contracts. The account storage used is calculated by the byte size of data currently stored in the account, and is directly tied to the balance of Flow tokens on the account. This is truly special as it gives users the ability to truly own the digital items they purchase, rather than a smart contract putting their name on it. Flow manages this storage by the amount of Flow tokens the account has, including a minimum storage feed of 0.001 $FLOW which equates to 100Kb of data to make sure it can handle any incoming assets. If for any reason the account attempts a transaction that would put it over its storage capacity then the transaction will fail. In the Flow account model, that car is in your garage with no contracts tied to it!

## Conclusion
Flow diverges from the normal EVM path with its account model in a way that is much needed in the blockchain space, as it paves the way for better asset management for users. In the Ethereum world there are countless cases of users loosing funds partly due to the account model on EVM chains which make it difficult to read and interpret what will happen when they press a button on a website. Flow on the other hand truly empowers users to own their digital assets and ensure funds will only leave their account with their permission, providing a newfound sense of security. On top of that, Flow gives developers the flexibility to build what they really want to build, making things like multi-signature weighed keys native to the platform, as well as multiple signature and hashing algorithms to choose from for the best compatibility among devices and networks. These are the qualities that sets Flow apart to help onboard the next million users to crypto and blockchain, and its thanks to small things like the account model that stops outside the bounds of typical blockchain technology.
