# My Developer Workflow Script
#tech/YouTube

- Introduction
  - Wanted to show you what tools I use for web development and productivity 
  - For context Iâ€™m head of dev rel at Pinata, an IPFS pinning service
  - My work spans from writing docs, creating apps/templates that use our services, creating content, and supporting users
  - The way I use these tools might be different than how other people use them, so of course just view this as my take on them. 
- Tmux + Neovim
  - Tmux for work spaces, split panes, background activity, layouts 
  - Neovim config has gone all over the place but finally settled on a modded version of the lazyvim starter. 
  - Use the file tree and telescope pretty regularly
  - Typically will have code on the left and terminal on the right or separate window 
  - Sometimes will have another window open for referencing other code bases 
- Tailscale
  - Creates a VPN for all your devices to be on which allows you access to each of them
  - Since all my dev flow is in Tmux I can simply ssh into my main machine from a secondary machine and open up any of those workspaces
  - Super powerful ability to have a central hub of development 
  - Available for just about any device
- Raycast
  - Window Management
  - Raycast AI
  - Color picker 
  - Clipboard History 
  - Jira 
  - Snippets?
- Arc
  - Not so much a developer browser but still works fine 
  - Use it primarily for its organizational abilities and keeping stuff in order
  - Makes it super fast to switch between projects and envs
- Notion / Obsidian 
  - I use Notion for work and Obsidian for personal 
  - If I could have it any way I wanted I would just use Obsidian 
  - However for team management and project tracking / internal docs, Notion is a no brainer. 
  - Not easy going between the two but it works for me
